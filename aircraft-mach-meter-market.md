<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Mach Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog Type</li><li>Digital Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft Mach Meter market is divided into two types: Analog Type and Digital Type. Analog Type meters display the aircraft's Mach number using traditional analog gauges, which provide a visual representation of the data. Digital Type meters, on the other hand, use digital displays to show the Mach number in a more precise and easy-to-read format. Both types have their own advantages, with Analog Type being more familiar to older pilots and Digital Type offering more accuracy and modern features.</p></p>
