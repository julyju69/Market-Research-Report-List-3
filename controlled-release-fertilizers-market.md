<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Controlled-release Fertilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulphur-coated urea (SCU)</li><li>Polymer-coated products</li><li>Polymer/ Sulphur-coated products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Controlled-release fertilizers are designed to gradually release nutrients to plants over an extended period. Sulphur-coated urea (SCU) is a type of controlled-release fertilizer where urea granules are coated with sulphur, allowing for slow nutrient release. Polymer-coated products have a polymer coating that controls the release of nutrients. Polymer/sulphur-coated products combine both technologies to provide a dual-release mechanism for optimal nutrient absorption by plants. These different types of controlled-release fertilizers offer various benefits in terms of nutrient efficiency and environmental sustainability.</p></p>
