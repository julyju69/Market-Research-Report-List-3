<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Sutures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable suture</li><li>Non-absorbable suture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical sutures can be classified into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable sutures. Absorbable sutures are designed to break down and be absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for removal. These are commonly used for internal tissues and are made from materials like catgut or polyglycolic acid. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, are intended to be permanent and must be removed after the wound has healed. They are typically made from materials like silk or nylon and are used for superficial wounds or in cases where prolonged wound support is needed.</p></p>
