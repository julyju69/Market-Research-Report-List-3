<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Black Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Black pellets are a type of advanced biomass fuel that has been processed to have higher energy density and improved handling characteristics. Two common methods used to produce black pellets are torrefaction and steam explosion (SE). Torrefaction involves heating the biomass in the absence of oxygen to remove moisture, volatile components, and improve the energy density. Steam explosion also removes moisture and volatile components by subjecting the biomass to high pressure steam, resulting in a more efficient and stable fuel product for use in power generation.</p></p>
