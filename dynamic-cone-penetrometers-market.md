<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dynamic Cone Penetrometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mass DCP</li><li>Dual-Mass DCP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dynamic Cone Penetrometers (DCP) are commonly categorized into two types: Single-Mass DCP and Dual-Mass DCP. Single-Mass DCPs have a single mass drop weight system for impacting the rod, allowing for simplified operation and lightweight design. On the other hand, Dual-Mass DCPs feature an additional mass that helps in reducing rebound effects and providing more accurate soil strength measurements. Both types of DCPs are widely used in geotechnical engineering for performing in-situ soil compaction and strength testing.</p></p>
