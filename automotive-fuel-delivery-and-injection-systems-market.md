<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Fuel Delivery and Injection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Throttle Body Fuel Injector</li><li>Direct Fuel Injector</li><li>Sequential Fuel Injector</li><li>Port Fuel Injector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive fuel delivery and injection systems consist of four main types: throttle body fuel injector, direct fuel injector, sequential fuel injector, and port fuel injector. Throttle body fuel injectors spray fuel into the throttle body, located at the entrance of the engine. Direct fuel injectors inject fuel directly into the combustion chamber for more precise fuel delivery. Sequential fuel injectors deliver fuel to each cylinder individually, while port fuel injectors spray fuel into the intake port of the engine. Each type of injector plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient fuel delivery and combustion in vehicles.</p></p>
