<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Refining Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hybrid</li><li>Premelted</li><li>Sintered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steel refining agents are used in the steelmaking process to remove impurities and improve the quality of the final product. There are three main types of steel refining agents: hybrid, premelted, and sintered. </p><p>Hybrid agents consist of a combination of different materials, providing a balanced approach to steel refining. Premelted agents are already melted before being added to the steel, allowing for quick and efficient mixing. Sintered agents are compacted and then heated to high temperatures, creating a solid product that slowly releases refining elements during the steelmaking process.</p></p>
