<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Twin-Screw Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sealed Twin-Screw Pump</li><li>Non-sealed Twin-Screw Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Twin-Screw Pumps have two main market types - Sealed Twin-Screw Pump and Non-sealed Twin-Screw Pump. Sealed Twin-Screw Pumps are designed with a seal to prevent leakage and are commonly used in applications where the pumped fluid is hazardous or needs to be contained. Non-sealed Twin-Screw Pumps, on the other hand, do not have a seal and are commonly used in applications where leakage is not a concern or where the pumped fluid is not hazardous. Both types of pumps serve different purposes based on the requirements of the application.</p></p>
