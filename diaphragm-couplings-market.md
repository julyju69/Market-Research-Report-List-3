<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Diaphragm</li><li>Double Diaphragm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diaphragm couplings are classified into two main types: single diaphragm and double diaphragm couplings. Single diaphragm couplings use one diaphragm to connect two shafts and transfer torque, allowing for misalignment compensation. Double diaphragm couplings, on the other hand, use two diaphragms to provide even greater flexibility in compensating for misalignment and reducing vibration. Both types are commonly used in industrial machinery and equipment to ensure smooth and efficient power transmission.</p></p>
