<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flotation Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Collector</li><li>Foaming Agent</li><li>Regulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flotation agents are chemicals used in the mining industry to separate valuable minerals from waste materials. There are three main types of flotation agents: collectors, foaming agents, and regulators. Collectors attach to the mineral surfaces, making them hydrophobic and aiding in their separation. Foaming agents create a stable foam that carries the mineral particles to the surface. Regulators control the pH levels and promote the formation of froth. Each type of agent plays a crucial role in the flotation process, ensuring efficient mineral recovery.</p></p>
