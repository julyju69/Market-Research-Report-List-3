<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Robotic Prescription Dispensing Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized Dispensing Systems</li><li>Decentralized Dispensing Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centralized dispensing systems involve a single location where prescriptions are filled and then transferred to various satellite locations for patient pickup. This system streamlines operations and improves efficiency. On the other hand, decentralized dispensing systems involve multiple locations where prescriptions are filled and dispensed on-site to patients. This system allows for quicker access to medications but may result in higher operational costs. Both centralized and decentralized systems aim to improve the prescription dispensing process but cater to different needs and preferences.</p></p>
