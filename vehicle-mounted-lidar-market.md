<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Mounted LiDAR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid State LiDAR</li><li>Mechanical LiDAR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vehicle Mounted LiDAR market includes two main types: Solid State LiDAR and Mechanical LiDAR. Solid State LiDAR uses semiconductor components to emit laser pulses and detect reflections, offering a smaller, more durable, and lower power consumption option. Mechanical LiDAR, on the other hand, relies on moving parts like rotating mirrors to emit and detect laser beams, providing higher resolution at longer ranges. Both types of LiDAR technology are used in vehicle-mounted systems for applications such as autonomous driving, mapping, and 3D modeling.</p></p>
