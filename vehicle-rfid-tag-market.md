<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle RFID Tag Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active RFID tags have their own power source and are able to broadcast signals to a reader. They are typically used for long-range tracking and data transmission, making them ideal for tracking vehicles in large areas such as parking lots or storage yards. Passive RFID tags, on the other hand, do not have their own power source and rely on the reader to power them and collect data. They are often used for shorter-range applications such as toll collection or access control.</p></p>
