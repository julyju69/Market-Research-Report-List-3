<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Acid Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-stage Pump</li><li>Single-stage Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Horizontal Acid Pumps come in two main types in the market: Multi-stage Pump and Single-stage Pump. Multi-stage pumps are designed with multiple impellers to generate higher pressure for pumping acid over long distances. They are suitable for applications where high pressure is required. On the other hand, Single-stage pumps have a single impeller and are ideal for pumping acid at lower pressure levels. They are commonly used for shorter distance applications or where lower pressure is sufficient. Both types cater to different needs in the acid pumping industry.</p></p>
