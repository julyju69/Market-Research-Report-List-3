<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chip Level Underfill Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluid Filler</li><li>Non Flowing Filler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chip level underfill is a process used in the semiconductor industry to protect chips from mechanical and thermal stresses. There are two main types of underfill materials: fluid filler and non-flowing filler. Fluid fillers flow easily and provide excellent protection, making them ideal for high-density chips. Non-flowing fillers are more viscous and provide greater mechanical strength, making them suitable for larger components or harsh environments. Both types of underfill materials play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and longevity of electronic devices.</p></p>
